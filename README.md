> Using ReactJS, Redis, websockets, MySQL, along with a RESTFUL API using
ExpressJS and PassportJS.

- Took this as a learning experience to improve my skills using ReactJS and
  learning about Redis.

- Project still on the works. I need to fix my reducers logic and I might change
  my API to use an ORM.

Installation:

- `npm install` the root and api folder.

- run the `.sql` inside api folder `/sql` after ceating `db1`.

- `redis-server`.

- `node main.js` in api folder.

- `npm run start`.
